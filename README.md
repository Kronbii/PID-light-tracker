# PID Light Tracker 🚦🤖

A compact robotics project that uses **PID control** to track a light source in real-time. With two servo motors for pan & pitch, an Arduino microcontroller, and LDR sensors, the robot adjusts its orientation smoothly and accurately to follow light.

This project is a hands-on way to learn about **control systems, robotics, and sensor integration**, while also demonstrating practical applications like automation and vision-guided systems.

* **`src/`** – Arduino PID control code
* **`CAD-models/`** – SolidWorks 2023 + STL files (robot design & 3D prints)
* **`proteus-simulation/`** – Circuit simulation files
* **`project-report/`** – Final course report
* **`project-video/`** – Demo video & YouTube link

⚠️ **Notes:**

* Some files can’t be previewed on GitHub — download them locally to view.
* CAD models require **SolidWorks 2023**.
