# PID Light Tracker 🚦🤖

A robotics project demonstrating **PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control** for autonomous light tracking. The robot uses servo motors for yaw and pitch adjustments, a light sensor for input, and a microcontroller to process signals and generate precise motor control.

This project highlights concepts in **control systems, sensor integration, and robotics** through a hands-on application.

## 📌 Project Overview

The robot is designed to:

* Detect and track a light source in real-time.
* Use **PID control** to adjust servo movements for smooth and accurate tracking.
* Showcase integration of **hardware (servo motors, sensors, chassis, power supply)** and **software (Arduino code, PID tuning, sensor processing)**.

By developing this project, we explored:

* PID tuning and calibration for optimal performance.
* System integration of mechanical, electrical, and software components.
* Practical robotics applications in automation and control.
